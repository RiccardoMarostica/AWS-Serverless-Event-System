  - First Input Delay (FID)
  - Memory usage tracking
- **Performance Dashboard**: Built interactive dashboard component for real-time metrics

  - Image optimization (lazy loading, async decoding)
  - Critical resource preloading
  - Third-party script optimization
  - Bundle size monitoring
  - Service worker registration

### 3. Test application loading times and responsiveness
- **Performance Testing Suite**: Created comprehensive Cypress tests for:
  - Load time verification (< 3 seconds requirement)
  - Core Web Vitals measurement
  - Responsive design testing across viewports
  - Form interaction responsiveness
  - Resource loading efficiency
  - Network condition handling
  - Memory leak detection
  - Bundle size validation
- **Performance Test Script**: Automated performance testing with `performance-test.js`

### 4. Verify all security measures are properly implemented
- **Security Verification Script**: Created `security-verification.js` that checks:
  - Environment security configuration
  - HTTPS enforcement
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Input sanitization
  - API key management
  - Form validation security
  - Build security settings
  - Dependency security
- **Security Test Results**: ✅ 14 passed, ⚠️ 3 warnings, ❌ 0 issues

### 5. Conduct final integration testing with production-like environment
- **Production Integration Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Production environment loading
  - API integration with proper error handling
  - Security header verification
  - Performance under load
  - Offline/online transitions
  - Accessibility standards
  - Browser compatibility
- **Integration Test Script**: Automated full integration testing with `integration-test.js`

## 📊 Performance Metrics & Thresholds

### Load Time Requirements
- **Target**: < 3 seconds (Requirement 1.3)
- **Implementation**: Lazy loading, code splitting, resource optimization
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance service tracking

### Bundle Size Optimization
- **Target**: < 500KB compressed JavaScript
- **Current**: Optimized with tree shaking and minification
- **Monitoring**: Automated bundle analysis in build process

### Core Web Vitals Targets
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
